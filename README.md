# Personal Expense Analysis
The purpose of this project is to empower individuals to take control of their finances by analyzing their spending habits. It uses Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib for visualizations, and NumPy for efficient numerical computations. The tool can graph trends, predict future expenses, and suggest cutbacks to help users manage their finances more effectively.

Whether you're budgeting for the first time or trying to improve your financial health, this tool helps you visualize spending patterns, forecast future spending, and identify areas where you can save.
